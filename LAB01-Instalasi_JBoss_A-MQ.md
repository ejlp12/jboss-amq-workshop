# LAB 01 â€“ INSTALLING JBOSS A-MQ

If you are starting from scratch, and not on a lab machine, you can continue this lab section with following instructions.

Installing JBoss A-MQ 6.2 is easy. You'll need to unzip the distribution into the target directory. You can get a JBoss A-MQ distribution from http://www.jboss.org/products/amq.

1. Extract (unzip) JBoss A-MQ binary installer.

   ```
   $ mkdir Servers
   $ cd Servers
   $ unzip ~/Downloads/jboss-a-mq-6.2.0.redhat-133.zip
   ```
   This will create a subdirectory named `jboss-a-mq-6.2.0.redhat-133`.

2. Edit configuration file

   You will need to edit a couple of configuration files after your first install to setup an administrative username and password.

   Edit `<JBoss A-MQ Home>/etc/users.properties`, and uncomment (remove the leading `#`) the last line. The format is `<username>=<password>,<role>,<role>`. For the purposes of this lab, let's use `admin` as a username and password is `admin`.

   ```
   admin=admin,admin
   ```

3. Start JBoss A-MQ

   Go to `<JBoss A-MQ Home>/bin` directory and Start the A-MQ broker using following command

   ```
   cd /Servers/jboss-a-mq-6.2.0.redhat-133/bin
   ./amq
   ```
   You will get following output and it will prompt you with A-MQ console:

    ```
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=128M; support was removed in 8.0
    Please wait, JBoss A-MQ is initializing...

    ```

   That's it! An install so fast, you don't even have time to get a cup of coffee...


By default, JBoss A-MQ will start in **interactive mode**, which means it both starts the server, and displays the command Console. There are startup options to refine this, such as 

* `./bin/amq server` to just start the server without the Console, and... 
* `./bin/amq client` to start just the Console that will connect to a locally running server.
